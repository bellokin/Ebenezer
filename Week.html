<p>
    Working with God through mission impossible

    Genesis 12:1. Now the LORD had said to Abram: "Get out of your country, From your family And from your father's house, To a land that I will show you.
    
    2. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you And make your name great; And you shall be a blessing.
    
    God is making the same promise to you tonight, just as has promised blessings to Abram, he is promising you tonight, the question is: are you willing to surrender just like Abram? Are you willing to forsake all pleasures for the cause of Christ?
    
    John 3:3. Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
    
    Psalms 95:8. "Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, As in the day of trial in the wilderness,
     
    God bless you as you listen to his message.
    
    Remember: James 1:22. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
    
     _God will bless you and make your name great only if you're willing to obey.
    _

    Memory Text: " ‘For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?' " (Mar 8:36-37, NKJV).

Jesus gave us the world's best investment strategy when He said: " ‘Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal' " (Mat 6:19-20, NKJV).

Jesus concludes His investment strategy by saying, " ‘For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also' " (Mat 6:21 NKJV). In other words: show Me what you spend your money on, and I will show you where your heart is, because wherever you put your money, your heart is sure to follow, if it's not there already.

Do you want a heart for the kingdom of God? If so, then put your money where it will reap eternal rewards. Put your time and your money and prayer into God's work. If you do, you will soon become even more interested in that work, and your heart will follow, as well.

<p>
    Genesis 35:1 . Then God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau."
2. So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.
3. Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone."

 Salvation is personal, don't think of what people will say if you decide to follow Christ or to accept him as your lord and savior . 

 Remember: 

Luke 9:26. For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the heavenly Father and of the holy angels.

 Will you be ashamed to accept Christ? 

 Don't let this opportunity pass you by. 

 John 3:3. Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."

    Sunday: Sabbath school lesson 
 
Topic_Noah found grace_ 

It is noteworthy to consider that those who are seeking heavenly trea- sure are frequently called by God to make major life alterations here on earth. Be prepared to face the same thing, if need be.


Read Gen 6:5-14. What radical changes came into Noah's life as a result of obeying God? What principles can we find here for ourselves in a world that needs to be warned about impending doom?

Noah could have spent his time and resources building a home for himself, but he chose to make a drastic change in his life and to spend 120 years of that life in following the call of God to build the ark.

Many skeptics today dismiss the story of the Flood as a myth, often based on scientific speculations about the known laws of nature. This is nothing new. "The world before the Flood reasoned that for centuries the laws of nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had come in their order. Heretofore rain had never fallen; the earth had been watered by a mist or dew. The rivers had never yet passed their boundaries, but had borne their waters safely to the sea. Fixed decrees had kept the waters from overflowing their banks."-Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 96.


Before the Flood, people argued that a flood could never come based on a faulty understanding of reality; after the Flood, based on a faulty understanding of reality, they argue that it never came to begin with. As the Bible says: "There is nothing new under the sun" (Eccl 1:9, NKJV).


Meanwhile, the Bible also says that people will be skeptical of end-time events, as they were of the Flood (see 2Pet 3:3-7). How can we, then, prepare for the coming destruction? There is a conscious decision called "delayed gratification." This basically means that we should patiently do the work God has called us to do in the hope of a more glorious future reward. We don't know when Christ will return. In one sense, it doesn't matter. What matters instead is that, like Noah, we do what God asks of us in the meantime, even if, as with Noah, it means some radical life changes.

How ready would you be to make a major change in your life for God if, like Noah, you were called to do just that? (Hint: See Luke 16:10.)

    Friday

<p>
    Abram, the father of the faithful.*_ 

    God called Abram to leave his homeland and his kinfolk and go to a land that He would show him. Thus began the bloodline of the Messiah. Though details aren't given, Abram had to leave the land of his birth and early years. Surely, it wasn't an easy decision, and no doubt he gave up some earthly pleasure and conveniences to do it.
    
    Read Gen 12:1-3. How were "all the families of the earth .  .  . blessed" as a result of this promise and its acceptance?
    
    This was a major life-changing event for Abram and his family. "By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going" (Heb 11:8, NKJV).
    
    "Abraham's unquestioning obedience is one of the most striking evidences of faith to be found in all the Bible."-Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 126. Most of us would not be eager to leave our homeland and our friends and family members. But Abram did so. Abram was satisfied to be where God wanted him to be. As strange as this may seem, Abram, Isaac, and Jacob never received that land in their lifetimes. Yet, they remained faithful to God anyway.
    
    
    Read Heb 11:8-13. What is the relevant message to us here?
    
    
    Abram was known as a prince by those living around him. He was known to be generous, brave, hospitable, and a servant of the Most High God. His witness for God was exemplary. By the grace of God, we are heirs with Abraham. "Just as Abraham ‘believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.' Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham" (Gal 3:6-7, NKJV). "And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Gal 3:29, NKJV).
    
    With Abraham, as with Noah, we see someone making a major life- changing decision as a result of obeying God.
    
    Read 2 Corinthians 4:18. How should the message of this verse impact the kind of spiritual decisions that we make? How did both Moses and Abraham follow that same principle?
