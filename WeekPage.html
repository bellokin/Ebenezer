Using the Bible to Decode Biblical Prophetic Symbols

<h2>
Step1
</h2>    
<p>
  <strong>Working with God through Mission Impossible</strong>
  <br><br>
  <strong>Step 1:</strong> Understand the classification of all biblical books by their style of presentation and content type. The following are the main categories:
  <ol>
      <li>Historical books/narratives</li>
      <li>Literary/poetic books</li>
      <li>Letters/Epistles</li>
      <li>Prophetic books, including:</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Direct all-time prophecies</li>
          <li>Apocalyptic prophecies</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>
  Step 2
</h2>

<p>
  Understanding Prophecies: 
  <br><br>
  What is the meaning of a prophecy? 
  <br>
  1 Corinthians 13:1, 2a - "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, ... And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge;"
  <br><br>
  Amos 3:7 - "Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets."
  <br><br>
  Prophecy, therefore, has to do with revealing the future - foretelling. It can also mean forth-telling where messages proceed from God through His prophet to address a matter in the present. For example, Ezekiel 33:11 - "Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
  <br><br>
  A very Special kind of Prophecy: 
  <br>
  Symbolic and relating to the time of the end - Apocalyptic Prophecies. 
  <br>
  Largely found in 2 major books of the Bible - Daniel and Revelation.
  <br><br>
  Some indicators of this are to be read in:
  <br>
  Daniel 2:28, 29 - "But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass."
  <br>
  Revelation 1:1-3 - "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unto his servants, even the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John; who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, even of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the time is at hand."
  <br><br>
  'Blessed' are those who read and hear the words of this prophecy and also keep the things that are written therein because the time of its fulfillment is near. If it was said to be near in about AD100 (approximately 1923 years ago) when John wrote the book, how much nearer do you think it must be today?
