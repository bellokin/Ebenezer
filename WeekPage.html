    “

These are words which I spoke to you wile I was still with you ,that all things must be fulfilled which was written in the law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning me 
    "
    
    
    (Acts 1:8)

  </strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">

        Starting a mission without planning it or making any preparation to carry it out is condemning it to failure.
        Therefore, it is necessary that we prepare adequately to carry out the most important mission of our life: sharing the good news of Salvation.
        

      </p>
  
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Reviewing the history of the apostles, we will begin by studying motivation – essential for the success of any mission; We will see the previous steps to take before starting; how to start the mission; and, finally, how to continue doing it without faltering or becoming discouraged.

  <u>Motivation For The Mission</u>
</h2>


<strong style="margin-left: 20px;">
"  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word…” (Matthew 28:8)"
</strong>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  While it was still dark, a group of women went to the tomb and found it empty. Some angels told them that Jesus had risen. They ran to share the news with the disciples.
On the way, Jesus himself appeared to them. Full of joy, they told the news (Lk. 24:1-9; Mt. 28:8-10).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Surprisingly, the disciples
  did not believe them. Peter ran to the tomb, corroborated the women's story, and was amazed (Luke 24:12). However, he did not share the news until he had a personal encounter with Jesus
  (Lk. 24:34).
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">

  Two other disciples ran from Emmaus to Jerusalem to tell that they had had an encounter with the resurrected Jesus
  (Lk. 24:30-33).
   </p>

   
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">

  Finally, the disciples believed when they saw Jesus in person (Luke 24:36). At that moment, Jesus entrusted them with the mission that, until then, they were not prepared to carry out (Lk. 24:46-49).

   </p>
   
   
<p style="margin-left:20px;">

  “We need to have a living connection with God ourselves in order to teach Jesus. Then we can give the living personal experience of what Christ is to us by experience and faith. We have received Christ and with divine earnestness we can tell that which is an abiding power with us. The people must be drawn to Christ. Prominence must be given to His saving efficacy”
</p>





<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>A Prophetic Foundation</u>
</h2>


<strong style="margin-left: 20px;">
  “These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you: that everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of Moses, in the prophets, and in the psalms” (Luke 24:44)
</strong>

<br>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  When the resurrected Jesus appeared before the disciples, they went from fear to joy and, finally, believed (Lk. 24:36-43).
  But, although personal experience is extremely important, Jesus was not satisfied with this. It led them to a second experience, not based on feelings but on reason: the knowledge of the prophetic Word of God
  (Lk. 24:44-46).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  In this way, our personal experience is complemented by a deep knowledge of the Bible and, especially, of the prophecies (2 Pet. 1:19). Note that this knowledge can only be achieved when Jesus “[opens our] understanding” (Lk. 24:45).
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Through the Old and New Testaments we can see how God announced historical events, and how they were fulfilled, especially those related to the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus.
   </p>

   
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">

  By studying the prophecies we can see how history has developed as it was announced in the Bible (see, for example, Daniel 2). With this knowledge we will be able to share with others these prophecies and others that have yet to be fulfilled, especially those related to the Second Coming of Jesus and eternal life.

   </p>
   
   
<p style="margin-left:20px;">

  “We need to have a living connection with God ourselves in order to teach Jesus. Then we can give the living personal experience of what Christ is to us by experience and faith. We have received Christ and with divine earnestness we can tell that which is an abiding power with us. The people must be drawn to Christ. Prominence must be given to His saving efficacy”

Prayer And Preparation For The Mission
</u>
<strong>
  “And Abraham came and said :Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked? "  
  (Genesis 18:23)

</strong>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Although they were motivated, and had already been commissioned to carry out the mission, they were asked to wait a while until they received “power from on high” (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4). What did they spend that waiting time on?
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Before beginning any project for God's work, we must seek His guidance in prayer, and prepare the logistics of the action: what will we need? Who will carry out each part?
How will we get the resources? …
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  To prayer ( Acts 1:14). “The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet men and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences…” (EGW, AA. pg. 37).

</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  To preparation ( Acts 1:15-26). The 12 being in charge of directing the mission, they proposed to repair the absence of one of them (Judas), so that the original plan could be followed. This was an act of “logistical preparation”
  
  </p>
 



    <u style="margin-left:20px;">
 Intercessory Prayer 
      </u>
   <strong> 

      (James 5:16) 

    </strong>  
 

    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Upon hearing the sentence on Sodom and 
      the surrounding cities, Abraham 
      interceded with God on behalf of its 
      unworthy inhabitants (Gen. 18:24).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Surely among them there are fair people 
      who do not deserve to die. Maybe 50… 
      45… 40… 30… 20… 10? (Gen. 18:25-32).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Actually, there were 4 (minus 1). And God spared an 
      entire city – Zoar – for their love (Gen. 19:20-21)! That 
      was the answer to Abraham's intercessory prayer.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      We must intercede for those with whom we are in 
      contact, not only for their physical needs, but also for 
      their conversion.
    </p>



    <u style="margin-left:20px;">
      ACCEPT INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS
           </u>
           <strong>
          (Genesis 18:25)
          </strong>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Abraham interceded for Sodom, 
  but only 3 people survived. Lot 
  interceded for his sons, daughters, 
  and sons-in-law, but only 2 
  daughters survived.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Was the intercession of these 
  righteous men a failure? No.
  God will not save anyone against their 
  own will. Salvation depends on each 
  person's choice.
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  However, intercessory prayer offers 
  opportunities for change that would not 
  otherwise be offered.
</p>

  <u>Practicing The Mission
  </u>
</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
 
 <strong>“All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them” (Acts 2:4)
</strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  We all have a part to play in the mission. To do this, each one is endowed with the gifts that the Spirit considers necessary (1Co. 12:11). In this way, the entire church, unanimously, proclaims the same message: Jesus has the power to save the vilest sinner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  By introducing Jesus, we allow the Holy Spirit to act on the heart of each person who listens, giving them the opportunity to repent and accept the Savior.

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  “Those who are of the household of faith should never neglect the assembling of themselves together; for this is God's appointed means of leading His children into unity, in order that in Christian love and fellowship they may help, strengthen, and encourage one another”
