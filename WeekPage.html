<u>HEALTH SONG</u>
</h2>    
<p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <strong>“Refrain”</strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">

        Health for you, health for me
        Health for all mankind!
        Healing for the halt and lame and vision for the blind,
        Health for you, health for me!
        Health for all mankind!
        This our goal, Our body whole
        In spirit, flesh and mind.
        
      </p>
      <br>
      <strong style="margin-left: 20px;">“1”</strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        If you want good health, 
        God’s health laws obey,
        All precepts heed, 
        never from them stray;
        Harmful habits shun, 
        Do not push yourself
        When too tired- or you may find
        Twill put you on “the shelf”!
        
        
      </p>

      <br>

      <strong style="margin-left: 20px;">“2”</strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Water is your friend!
        Used within, without
        Cleanses, soothes and heals,
        Put the germs to rout;
        Rest repairs the rents
        Stress of healing brings,
        Loosens taut and “ragged” nerves
        And gives the spirit wings!
        
        
        
      </p>


      <br>

      <strong style="margin-left: 20px;">“3”</strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Sunshine and fresh air,
        Clean and wholesome food,
        Proper exercise,
        Thoughts upright and good,
        Keeps the cheeks aglow,
        Bodies fit and strong,
        Keep the brain alert and clean,
        And give the heart a song!
        
        
        
      </p>
      

      <br>

      <strong style="margin-left: 20px;">“4”</strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Take some time to play;
        Stand straight, breathe in deep:
        Work while it is day;
        Always get your sleep,
        Eat just what you need-
        Never more, nor less;
        Moderation is the guide
        To health and happiness!

  <u>EIGHT TRUE REMEDIES</u>
</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
 
 <strong> Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power- these are the true remedies. (MH 127.2).</strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  The use of natural remedies requires an amount of care and effort that many are not willing to give. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Nature’s process of healing and upbuilding is gradual, and to the impatient it seems slow. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  The surrender of hurtful indulgences requires sacrifice, but in the end it will be found that nature, untrammeled, does her work wisely and well.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Those who persevere in obedience to her laws will reap the reward in health of body and health of mind!
</p>

<br>

<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Nutrients </u>
</h2>
<br>

<p  style="margin-left: 20px;" >
  <strong>“Out of the ground made the lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.” (Genesis 2:9)</strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Nutrients in food is what your body need for energy, growth, and repair of cells, tissues, organs and systems. Nutrients protect your body from disease and eating raw or simply prepared fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and grains will help you maintain a health body weight. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">

  Food is to be our medicine.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Junk foods (packaged, processed, fried and heavily preserved and flavored with oils, salts and sugar) have little of the essential vitamins and minerals that the body requires. A variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds contain all the essential vitamins, minerals, water, carbohydrates, calcium, protein, fats, and fiber to make good blood and enjoy health. 
</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Exercise</u>
</h2>
<p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
 <Strong>Exodus 20: 9 “Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work..”</Strong>
</p>
<p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Regular exercise accompanied with a healthy plant based diet improves your health and reduces the risk of developing almost all diseases. 
</p>
  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
    
    Exercise provides a powerful increase of oxygen to the body and can have immediate and long term health benefits and will improve your quality of life. To maintain health and reduce your risk of illness, a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-intense exercise is required daily.   </p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Walking is one of the simplest and best exercises, and is inexpensive!
</p>
  <hr>
<br>


<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Water</u>
</h2>
<p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <Strong>Rev 21:6: "And he said unto me, It is done. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely." </Strong>
 </p>


 <p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Your body is 75% water and your brain is 85% water. Water is important in many body functions. In order to live longer, better, healthier lives, we need to develop the habit of drinking generous amounts of water. We need to drink at least eight glasses of water daily.</p>
 
  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;">
    
    Dehydration can mimic hypoglycaemia, causing headaches, tiredness, and fainting spells. Drink your water!
</p>
<hr>
<br>


<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Sunlight</u>

</h2>

  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;" >
<strong>John 8:12 "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Vitamin D is one of those substances that our bodies need to eliminate “free radicals”- toxins in our modern environment, which are believed to cause many of our ailments including cancer and auto-immune diseases.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    Getting adequate amount of sunshine each day is important in maintaining high levels of vitamin D. Sunshine is one of nature’s most healing agents; it naturally calms the nerves. It destroys bacteria, and thus can help prevent or heal infections. Sunlight reduces blood pressure and blood sugar and increases red and white blood cells.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Be careful not to get a Sunburn!</p> 
<hr>
<br>

<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Temperance</u>

</h2>

  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;" >
<strong>

  1 Corinth. 9:25 " And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.” 
</strong>

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Balance and good sense are key in all things. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Temperance is self-discipline, which is self-control. True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything harmful and to use judiciously only that which is healthful. Temperance is a fruit of the spirit of which God would have us develop in all areas of our lives, including eating, drinking, sleeping, dress, work habits, recreation and study time. Practicing temperance rewards us with mental and moral vigor, resulting in godly balance. 

  </p>

  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    Avoid everything that is harmful to the bod, taken internally or used externally.
    </p> 

<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Air</u>

</h2>

  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;" >
    <strong>
      Gen 2:7 "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
  </strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  We can for weeks without food, days without water, but only minutes without air! Remember to take some deep breaths several times a day, preferably outdoors. 
  Oxygen is the most essential element for man and animals to sustain life. Fresh air invigorates the vital organs and aids the system in eliminating accumulated impurities.
  
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Fresh air brings life to the skin and has a decided influence on the mind. Clean, pure air contains negative ions which help the immune system fight disease. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Fresh air gives clarity to the mind, improves concentration and boosts learning abilities, soothes nerves, helps to circulate the blood throughout the system, excites the appetite, renders better digestion and induces sound sleep.
</p>

<br>
<hr>

<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>REST</u>

</h2>

  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;" >
    <strong>
      Ecclesiastes 5:12 “The sleep of a laboring man is sweet.”  </strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Rest is the replenisher. The proper quantity and quality of sleep is vital to a healthful lifestyle. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  During a day of work and activity, toxins build up in our system which cannot immediately be thrown off. Sleep gives the body to expel these toxins and to heal and repair natural forces that have been used during the day.</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  One hour of sleep before midnight is more beneficial than two hours of sleep after midnight.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    If we eat before going to bed, digestion takes the place of restoration and the body will become weakened, sick and diseased.
  </p>

<br>
<hr>


<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>TRUST IN GOD
  </u>

</h2>

  <p  style="margin-left: 20px;" >
    <strong>
      Prov 3:5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  </strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  When we allow God into our lives, our brains are ‘turned on’, our bodies are made more efficient, our immune systems are strengthened, thinking becomes clearer, and well, we feel great! </p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  There is an inexpressible peace that comes to one who has learned to trust in God and to lay all things in His hands. Jesus says, “Come unto Me…and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)

  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    God will not work a miracle to keep us from sickness and disease if we have no care for ourselves or if we choose to live and eat and drink as we please. When, however, we do all that we can on our part to obey God, we may have confidence that God will cooperate with us in keeping our bodies in health, and we can experience peace, happiness and health!
