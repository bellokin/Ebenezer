  <strong>
    
    “The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved."
    (Psalm 93:1)
        "
    
    
    (Acts 1:8)

  </strong>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        The psalms proclaim God's sovereignty over the entire Earth. He is the King over every earthly government, and over every person who lives on our planet.

      </p>
  
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Although many governments do not accept divine sovereignty, or are even in open rebellion against it, God has loyal subjects throughout the world who adhere to the covenant that the Creator, King and Judge offers us, and are loyal to his Law.

  <u>THE CREATOR  </u>
</h2>


<strong style="margin-left: 20px;">
  “When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained”    (Psalm 8:3)
</strong>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Looking around us, we can think that humanity is great, that it has done great feats and wonders. But the psalmist confidently declares: “Know that the Lord is God; He made us, and not we ourselves” (Ps. 100:3).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  We are mere stewards of what God has created (Ps. 8:5-9 ). He alone deserves our supreme worship and loyalty.

</p>

 



<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>THE KING
  </u>
</h2>


<strong style="margin-left: 20px;">
  “The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof” (Psalm 97:1)
</strong>

<br>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Psalms shows God as a king clothed in honor, majesty and strength (Ps. 93:1), covered with light (Ps. 104:2). According to Psalms, why is God proclaimed King?

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Despite being the King of the entire Earth and ruling with justice and mercy, few recognize His sovereignty.
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  However, his disciples do delight in his righteous judgments (Ps. 97:8, 12). By faith, God's people rejoice in the establishment of God's Kingdom through the redemptive ministry of Christ and look forward to the consummation of the Kingdom at his second coming (Dan. 2:44).

  <u> JUDGE

  </u>
</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
 
 <strong>“You say, “I choose the appointed time;
  it is I who judge with equity” (Psalm 75:2)"

</strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  As sovereign King, God is also Lawgiver and Judge (Ps. 99:7; 7:11). Psalm 75 vividly describes the work of the Judge and the process and culmination of his judgment:

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  The Judge has appointed a time when he will begin to judge (Ps. 75:2)

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Before judging each case, God warns and gives opportunity to the wicked to repent (Ps. 75:4-7)
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Judgment will be held and executed before humanity itself destroys the Earth(Ps. 75:3)

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  At the end of the judgment, God will pour out the plagues of the cup of wrath, full of mixed wine, on the wicked (Ps. 75:8)
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Finally, all unrepentant sinners will be destroyed forever; and the righteous will live forever (Ps. 75:10)

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Why, before speaking of judgment, does the psalmist give thanks to God (Ps. 75:1)?,Because those of us who trust in the love of God have nothing to fear from judgment, since our sins have been forgiven and we trust in the Advocate who loses no case ( James 2:13; 1Jn. 2:1).


</p>

  <u> THE PACT


  </u>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
 
 <strong>“Arise, O Lord, in Your anger;
  Lift Yourself up because of the rage of my enemies;
  Rise up me to the judgment You have commanded!” (Psalm 7:6 NKJV )
  

</strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  The assurance that God's people have of being acquitted at judgment is based on the covenant that God has made with them (Ps. 105:7-8).

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  He made the covenant with Abraham and Isaac (Ps. 105:9)

</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  He settled them in Canaan, the Promised Land (Ps. 105:44)

</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  He ratified it with Jacob, which is Israel (Ps. 105:10-11)

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  When they were enslaved, he freed them (Ps. 105:25-38)

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  As part of the covenant, the people were to keep the Law (Ps. 105:45)

</p>



<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Since they were few and weak, he protected them         (Ps. 105:12-15)

</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  He protected them in the desert (Ps. 105:39-43)

</p>

  <u>
    Summary

  </u>
</h2>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  “Our Creator justly claims the right to do as He chooses with the creatures of His hand. He has a right to govern as He will, and not as man chooses. But He is not a severe judge, a harsh, exacting creditor. He is the very fountain of love, the giver of blessings innumerable. [...] We do not deserve all His benefits; but they are continued to us, notwithstanding our unworthiness and cruel ingratitude. Then cease to complain as though you were bond servants under a hard taskmaster. Jesus is good. Praise Him. Praise Him who is the health of your countenance, and your God.”
