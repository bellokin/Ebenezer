    “A new commandment I give you: that you love one another.May they love each other as I have loved you.By this all will know that you are my diciples,if you love one another"
    

    
    
    (Acts 1:8)

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">

        God's mission is to save humanity. 
        To achieve his purpose, He has assigned each of 
        us a part in fulfilling that mission.

      </p>
  
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Through the example of Abraham, we will study 
        some of the ways in which we can share God's 
        mission.

  <u>SHARING GOD'S MISSION</u>
</h2>


<u style="margin-left:20px;">
  THE HOSPITALITY</u>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Sitting in the shade of the door of his tent, Abraham 
  saw three people pass by him. Immediately, he ran 
  towards them. He did not wait for them to request his 
  hospitality (if they intended to do so), but took the 
  initiative and offered them what he had (Gen. 18:1-8).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Abraham wanted to satisfy, to the best of his ability, the 
  needs of those with whom he interacted – not only the 
  material ones, but also the spiritual ones. Therefore, he 
  built an altar wherever he went (Gen. 12:7-8; 13:18).
  In this way, he became a blessing to those around him. 
  An example to imitate.
</p>

 
<u style="margin-left:20px;">
 
LOVE FOR OTHERS
</u>
<strong>
  “And Abraham came and said :Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked? "  
  (Genesis 18:23)

</strong>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Who was Abraham worried about, the righteous or the wicked (Gen. 18:23)?
  Abraham had had the opportunity to meet the inhabitants 
  of Sodom when he rescued them from Chedorlaomer and 
  accompanied them back to their city (Gen. 14:14-16, 21). 
  He knew they were wicked. He also knew that a righteous 
  family dwelt among them (2 Pet. 2:7).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
  God knew Abraham's heart, so he explained his plans to 
  him, and waited for his reaction (Gen. 18:17-21).
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  If Abraham had not loved the wicked inhabitants 
  of Sodom, he would have said: “Rescue my 
  nephew, do not let him perish with the wicked.” 
  But that wasn't what he asked for.

</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  We are to love others because God died for them, and there is still hope that, at 
  some point in their lives, they will accept salvation.
  
  </p>
 


    <u style="margin-left:20px;">
 Intercessory Prayer 
      </u>
   <strong> 

      (James 5:16) 

    </strong>  
 

    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Upon hearing the sentence on Sodom and 
      the surrounding cities, Abraham 
      interceded with God on behalf of its 
      unworthy inhabitants (Gen. 18:24).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Surely among them there are fair people 
      who do not deserve to die. Maybe 50… 
      45… 40… 30… 20… 10? (Gen. 18:25-32).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      Actually, there were 4 (minus 1). And God spared an 
      entire city – Zoar – for their love (Gen. 19:20-21)! That 
      was the answer to Abraham's intercessory prayer.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;">
      We must intercede for those with whom we are in 
      contact, not only for their physical needs, but also for 
      their conversion.
    </p>



    <u style="margin-left:20px;">
      ACCEPT INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS
           </u>
           <strong>
          (Genesis 18:25)
          </strong>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Abraham interceded for Sodom, 
  but only 3 people survived. Lot 
  interceded for his sons, daughters, 
  and sons-in-law, but only 2 
  daughters survived.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Was the intercession of these 
  righteous men a failure? No.
  God will not save anyone against their 
  own will. Salvation depends on each 
  person's choice.
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  However, intercessory prayer offers 
  opportunities for change that would not 
  otherwise be offered.
</p>

<br>

<h2  style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <u>Submit To The Divine Will
  </u>
</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
 
 <strong>"And Abraham went up in the morning […] And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, […] and, 
  behold, the smoke was rising from the earth like the smoke of a furnace” (Genesis 19:27-28)
</strong>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  When God called him to go to Canaan and be a blessing to the 
world, Abraham obeyed (Gen. 12:1-5). He did not ignore the 
call, nor did he give it any ifs or buts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  Having to separate from his nephew, he let him choose the 
  territory, knowing that God would fulfill his will in any case 
  (Gen. 13:8-12, 14-15).
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  After his intercessory prayer for Sodom, Abraham left 
the next morning hoping to see his request fulfilled. 
But what he saw was destruction (Gen. 19:27-28).
</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
  There were no complaints from him. Once again he 
  submitted to the divine will. We must always accept 
  God's will
</p>

  <u>Summary
  </u>
  </h2>

  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    
    
    “Love for perishing souls inspired Abraham's 
prayer. While he loathed the sins of that 
corrupt city, he desired that the sinners 
might be saved. His deep interest for Sodom 
shows the anxiety that we should feel for the 
impenitent. We should cherish hatred of sin, 
but pity and love for the sinner”
